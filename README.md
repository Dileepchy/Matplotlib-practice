# Matplotlib and Pyplot Tutorial in Python

Welcome to the Matplotlib Tutorial in Python repository!
The DataCamp Matplotlib Tutorial inspires this project and aims to provide hands-on examples, code snippets, and explanations for mastering data visualization using Matplotlib.

matplotlib.pyplot is a collection of functions that make matplotlib work like MATLAB. Each pyplot function makes some change to a figure: e.g., creates a figure, creates a plotting area in a figure, plots some lines in a plotting area, decorates the plot with labels, etc.

# 📊 Overview

Matplotlib is the most popular Python library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. This repository will help you:

Understand the basics of Matplotlib.
Create different types of plots (line, bar, scatter, histogram, etc.).
Customize your plots (titles, labels, legends, colors, styles).
Save and export your visualizations.
